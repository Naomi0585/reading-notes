# Design Web pages with CSS # 

## **What is the purpose of CSS?** 

*Cascading Style Sheets* better known as **CSS** allows you to customize your website. By using **CSS** you can control how your HTML elements look on the browser, presenting your page with the design and layout of your choosing. 

### <ins>**How to use CSS**</ins> ###
There are 3 main ways to insert **CSS** into your project: 
* **External CSS**:  Writting it into a separate `.css` file then linking it in your HTML. 
* **Internal CSS**: Placing it inside a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` of your HTML file. 
* **Inline CSS**: Adding it directly to an HTML element using the `style` attribute. 

### Example: ### 

If you use the **CSS** rule that follows: 

*P* {
       color: red;
}

It will give all the `<p>` elements red text.
