# Structure Web Pages with HTML #

## What is HTML? ## 

* HyperText Markup Language or better know as HTML is the most basic element of a web. It defines the meaning and structure of said web. *HyperText* refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either individually or in groups. Links are a fundamental aspect of a web. 

* HTML uses *Markup* to annotate text, images and other content for display on a web browser. 

## Elements ##

HTML markup contains special *"elements"* . An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by *"tags"* which consist of the element surrounded by `<` & `>`.

When you give an element additional information it is known as an `attribute`. Attributes are additional information added to HTML elments to manipulate how they behave or appear. Its important also to know what are semantics in programming which just refers to the meaning of a code. In HTML a *semantic* element gives the text it wraps around the role or meaning of a "top level heading" on your page.
