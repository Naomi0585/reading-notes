## Symbols in Markdown

To create a ** header ** you should use: #.
-The largest heading will need: one '#' symbol. This would be known as "Heading Level 1".
-The smallest heading will need: 6 '#' symbols. This would be known as "Heading Level 6".
To make a text 'bold' you shuold use 2 asterisks (*) or underscores (_) before and after the phrase or word you want to emphasize. 
To make a text 'italicized' add one asterisk (*) or underscore (_) before and after the phrase or word you want to emphazise. 
To create a ** link ** enclose the link text in brackets ([]) and then follow it immediately with the URL enclosed in parenthesis (()). 
For unordered (bulleted) lists you can use 3 symbols. Use either dashes, asterisks or plus signs in front of the line items. In the case you need to start the unordered list with numbers lets say followed by a period, you use a backlash (\) to escape that period.
